# TidyData
Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course Project

==================================================================
This project uses  data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
From theHuman Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0; developed by: Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

==================================================================

The experiments were done with 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years, performing six activities wearing a smartphone on thier waist:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, training data and test data. 

The purpose of the project was to Tidy the data set:

 * Merge the training and the test sets 
 * Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 * Apply descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 * From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
